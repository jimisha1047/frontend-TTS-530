<!-- Describe the difference between block level and inline elements in html -->

<!-- Block-level elements -->

New Line: Block-level elements always start on a new line.

Width: By default, they take up the full available width of their parent container.

Structure: They are typically used for structuring the overall layout and hierarchy of a webpage, acting as containers for other elements.

Content: They can contain both other block-level elements and inline elements.
 
Examples: Common examples include <div>, <p>, <h1> through <h6>, <ul>, <ol>, and <li>. 


<!-- inline elements -->

Inline Elements:

No New Line: Inline elements do not start on a new line and flow within the content of a block-level element.

Width: They only occupy as much horizontal space as necessary to contain their content. 

Content: They typically contain only data or other inline elements.

Purpose: They are primarily used for text-level semantics, formatting, and styling within a block of content.

Examples: Common examples include <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, <img>, and <br>.
