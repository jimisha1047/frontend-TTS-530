Que-1) explain the difference between inline , internal and external css.
answer - (A) Inline CSS: Styles are written directly inside an element’s style attribute.
  Example: <h1 style="color: red;">Hello</h1>
  Quick for single element changes but not reusable.

(B) internal CSS: Styles are written inside the <style> tag in the HTML file’s <head>.
  Example:
html
  <style>
      h1 { color: red; }
</style>
   
   ood for single-page projects.

(C) External CSS: Styles are written in a separate .css file and linked using <link>.
  Example:

  html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
  

Best for large projects, reusable across multiple pages.
  



Que-2) describe CSS Selectors and list the types of selectors?
Answer- 1)Element Selector → targets all elements of a type. Example: p { color: blue; }
2)Class Selector → targets elements with a specific class. Example: .text { font-size: 16px; }
3)ID Selector → targets a unique element with an ID. Example: #title { text-align: center; }
4)Universal Selector (*) → applies to all elements.
5)Group Selector (,) → applies to multiple selectors at once. Example: h1, p { color: black; }
6)Descendant Selector → targets nested elements. Example: div p { color: green; }
7)pseudo element-selector →  A pseudo-element selector styles a specific part of an element that is not explicitly defined in the HTML structure. Example: p::first-line {
                               color: blue;                 
                             }
8)pseudo class selector → A pseudo-class selector styles an element based on its state or position within the document tree. Pseudo-classes start with a single colon :.
 Example: a:hover {
            color: red;
          }

9)combinator selector → Combinator selectors define the relationship between other selectors, allowing for more complex selections.
10)combinator adjacent selector → The adjacent sibling combinator + selects an element that is immediately preceded by another specified element. Example: h1 + p {
                             margin-top: 20px;
                            }
11)combinator parent-child selector → The child combinator > selects elements that are direct children of another specified element. Example: div > p {
                   font-weight: bold;
                  }
12)attributes selector → An attribute selector selects elements based on the presence or value of their HTML attributes.
Example: input[type="text"] {
  border: 1px solid gray;
}
